1)  Do not read directly from env because there may be the chance that the value of the env variable
    changed mistakenly. So read it from a config module.

//  process is an event emitter

2)  process.on('exit', code =>{
        // do one final synchronous operation before node process terminates
        // we cannot do asynchronous operation here (that is, we can use event loop here)
    });

3) process.on('uncaughtException', code =>{
        // If we add a handler in the uncaughtException event then node process will not exit
        // an continues in the unpredictable manner. So avoid using handler and let the process
        // exit or manually exit the process in the handler
    });
