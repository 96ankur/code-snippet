                                        PROMISE

Promise object has to value:
1) status
2) value

A promise can be in 3 states:
1) PENDING
2) FULFILLED or
3) REJECTED

# Promise.all
# Promise.allSettled (return an object when all the promises are resolved)

# Promise.race (race rejects with the first rejected promise)
# Promise.any  ('any' rejects when all the promoises rejects)

# Promise.resolve
# Promise.reject

==========> Takes callback rather then ".then()" (Bluebird)

# Promise.map       (same as 'all' but we can control concurrency of parallel hits)
# Promise.mapSeries (same as 'map' with concurrency 1)
