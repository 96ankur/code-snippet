=> Everything that is asynchronous is not handled by a thread pool
   Libuv creates a pool with four threads that is only used if no asynchronous API is avaliable

   Not all the I/O functions happen in the thread pool. NodeJS do most of the I/O using non-blocking and
   asynchronous hardware I/O, but for the I/O types which blocks or are complex to address, it uses the thread
   pool.

   However, I/O is not the only type of tasks performed on the thread pool. There are some Node.js crypto 
   functions such as crypto.pbkdf2, async versions of crypto.randomBytes,crypto.randomFill and async versions of
   zlib functions which run on the libuv thread pool because they are highly CPU intensive.
   Running them on the threadpool prevents blocking of the event loop.

                         ------------> EVENT LOOP PHASES <--------------

                                         Timmers
                                        callbacks
                                       I/O Polling
                                      set Immediate
                                      Close events

=>  Switch between one phase to another is called a TICK.

-> Timmers  [ setTimeout(), setInterval()]
-> I/O polling [system events(file operation)]
=> Event Loop does not run in a separate thread than the user code.
   There is only one thread that executes the Javascript code and this is the thread where event loop is running

=> Event loop is not like a stack or queue.
   It is a set of phases with dedicated data structures for each phase.

=> After processing one phase and before moving to the next phase, event loop will process two intermediate
   queues until no items are remaining in the intermediate queues.

=> There are 4 main types of queues that are processed by the native libuv event loop.

=> Besides these 4 main queues, there are additionally 2 queues which are processed by Node. 
   Although these queues are not part of libuv itself but are parts NodeJS. They are,
   -> Next Ticks Queue — Callbacks added using process.nextTick function (This queue isnot natively provided by the libuv, but 
                         implemented in Node.)
   -> Other Microtasks Queue — Includes other microtasks such as resolved promise callbacks

=> Next tick queue vs Other Microtasks

   Next tick queue has even higher priority over the Other Micro tasks queue. Although, they both are
   processed in between two phases of the event loop when libuv communicates back to higher layers of Node
   at the end of a phase.

   Priority for next tick queue over resolved promises is only applicable for the native JS promises provided
   by v8. If you are using a library such as q or bluebird, you will observe an entirely different result.

   The convention of these so-called ‘intermediate’ queues introduces a new problem, "IO STARVATION".
   Extensively filling up the next tick queue using process.nextTick function will force the event loop to
   keep processing the next tick queue indefinitely without moving forward. This will cause IO starvation
   because the event loop cannot continue without emptying the next tick queue.

=> Q uses "process.nextTick" queue to schedule callbacks for resolved/rejected promises.

==>  BlueBird

-> Bluebird uses "setImmediate" by default to schedule promise callbacks.
-> Bluebird, however, provides us a choice. We can select our own scheduling mechanism. 
   Bluebird provides an API method named "setScheduler" which accepts a function which overrides the default
   setImmediate scheduler.
   
   To use process.nextTick as the scheduler in bluebird you can specify,
      const BlueBird = require('bluebird');
      BlueBird.setScheduler(process.nextTick);

   and to use setTimeout as the scheduler in bluebird you can use the following code,
      const BlueBird = require('bluebird');
      BlueBird.setScheduler((fn) => {
          setTimeout(fn, 0);
      });

            ---------------> DOS AND DON’TS TO GET THE BEST RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE <----------------

-> Avoid sync I/O inside repeatedly invoked code blocks
-> Functions should be completely async or completely sync

   The rule of thumb is, the function you write should be,
   -> Completely synchronous — Behave synchronously for all the inputs/conditions
   -> Completely asynchronous — Behave asynchronously for all the inputs/conditions.
      
      If your function is a hybrid of the above two and behaves differently for different inputs/conditions,
      it may result in unpredictable outcomes of your applications.

-> Too many nextTicks
   While process.nextTick is very useful in many cases, recursively using process.nextTick can result in I/O
   starvation.

-> dns.lookup() vs dns.resolve*()

-> Event loop monitoring

   const LoopBench = require('loopbench');
   const loopBench = LoopBench();

   console.log(`loop delay: ${loopBench.delay}`);
   console.log(`loop delay limit: ${loopBench.limit}`);
   console.log(`is loop overloaded: ${loopBench.overlimit}`);


-> WITH THE NEW CHANGES IN NODE V11, NEXTTICK CALLBACKS AND MICROTASKS WILL RUN BETWEEN EACH INDIVIDUAL
   SETTIMEOUT AND SETIMMEDIATE CALLBACKS, EVEN IF THE TIMERS QUEUE OR THE IMMEDIATES QUEUE IS NOT EMPTY.
